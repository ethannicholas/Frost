Identifier
==========

An *identifier* is a name used in a Frost program to refer to a [class](classes.md),
[method](methods.md), [variable](variables.md), or other program element.

Identifiers must begin with a letter or underscore (`_`), and continue with any number of letters,
underscores, or digits. [Keywords](keywords.md) are reserved and may not be used as identifiers. An
underscore by itself is not a legal identifier, as that is used to ignore values when extracting
values from a [tuple](tuples.html) in a [multiple assignment](statements.md#assignment).
