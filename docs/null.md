null
====

`null` is a [keyword](keywords.md) which represents the absence of a value. [Types](types.md)
are not nullable by default, meaning that `null` is a not a legal value for most types. See the
page on [non-nullability](nonNullability.md) for a full description of nullable and non-nullable
types.

The value `null` can be [implicitly cast](implicitCasting.md) to any nullable type.
