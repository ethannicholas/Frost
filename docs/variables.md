Variables
=========

A variable is a named value which can be changed to contain a different value. Variables are defined
with the syntax:

    var x:Int := 12, y:Int := 0

The type declarations may be omitted to infer the type of the variable from its assigned value, or
the assignment may be omitted to leave the variable unitialized. The type and assignment may not
both be omitted.

The value of a variable may be changed using an [assignment statement](statements.html#assignment).
