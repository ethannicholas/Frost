Overview
========

Frost is a general purpose multi-paradigm programming language with support for:

* First-class immutable objects and value types
* First-class functions and closures
* Type inference
* Non-nullable references, static proofs of `null` safety
* Contracts (preconditions and postconditions)
* Tuples
* "Sane" operator overloading
* Actor model threading

And many other features. Frost is still under development; it is nearly feature complete, but not
quite ready for prime time yet.

Installation
