Overview
========

Panda is a general purpose multi-paradigm programming language with support for:

* First-class immutable objects and value types
* First-class functions and closures
* Type inference
* Non-nullable references, static proofs of `null` safety
* Contracts (preconditions and postconditions)
* Tuples
* "Sane" operator overloading
* Actor model threading

And many other features. Panda is still under development; it is nearly feature complete, but not
quite ready for prime time yet.

Installation
============

To install Panda, see the 'docs/gettingStarted.md' file.

Panda would not have been possible without the help of other amazing open-source projects,
including:

    LLVM  (http://llvm.org/)
    ICU   (http://site.icu-project.org/)
    CMake (http://cmake.org/)
