Frost solutions to the Advent of Code problems at http://adventofcode.com, which is a really fun set
of programming challenges you should try. 

These programs are generally brief, but not heavily golfed; I have tried to strike a reasonable
balance between elegance, readability, and performance. But, since these are meant to be tests that
stress Frost out and not examples of beautiful, maintainable code, there's a definite tendency to do
everything in a fancy functional manner even when a simple for loop would be a lot more practical.
This was my place to blow off steam and write crazy, ridiculous code that doesn't belong in a real
program.

I have taken the liberty of including the problem text in each program so that you can understand
what each program is doing without having to get the problems from the web yourself (which, given
that you can't see Part 2 until you have solved Part 1, is easier said than done). I would
nonetheless encourage you to give it a shot.
