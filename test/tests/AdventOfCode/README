Frost solutions to the Advent of Code problems at http://adventofcode.com, which is a really fun set
of programming challenges you should try. 

These programs are generally brief, but not heavily golfed; I have tried to strike a reasonable
balance between elegance, readability, and performance. There are some spots where I deliberately
stress Frost out by doing "weird" things; the fancy functional stuff in Day23 is a good example of
this. It's completely unnecessary and slower than the naive approach, but it was fun to write and is
a good test.

I have taken the liberty of including the problem text in each program, in part so these still make
sense on the off chance that adventofcode.com is no longer available at some point in the future.
