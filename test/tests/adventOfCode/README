Frost solutions to the Advent of Code problems at http://adventofcode.com, which is a really fun set
of programming challenges you should try. 

These programs are generally brief, but not heavily golfed; I have tried to strike a reasonable
balance between elegance, readability, and performance. I have also generally tried to not take
advantage of peculiarities in the input (for instance, it is possible to solve 2015/Day7 more easily
by sorting the input,but the fact that that works is essentially just an accident of how the input 
was generated, and I do not wish to take advantage of that).

I have taken the liberty of including the problem text in each program, in part so these still make
sense on the off chance that adventofcode.com is no longer available at some point in the future.
