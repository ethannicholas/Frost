You're in a cave with 20 rooms and 3 tunnels leading from each room.
There are 3 bats and 3 pits scattered throughout the cave, and your
quiver holds 5 custom super anti-evil Wumpus arrows. Good luck.

You are in room 7 of the cave, and have 5 arrows left.
*rustle* *rustle* (must be bats nearby)
There are tunnels to rooms 13, 12, and 1.
m<room#> to move, s<room#s> to shoot: 
*flap*  *flap*  *flap*  (humongous bats pick you up and move you!)
You are in room 4 of the cave, and have 5 arrows left.
*whoosh* (I feel a draft from some pits).
*sniff* (I can smell the evil Wumpus nearby!)
There are tunnels to rooms 18, 2, and 16.

A horrible roar fills the cave, and you realize, with a smile, that you
have slain the evil Wumpus and won the game!  You don't want to tarry for
long, however, because the stench of a dead Wumpus is also quite well
known, a stench powerful enough to slay the mightiest adventurer with
a single whiff!!
Care to play another game? (y/n)
