You're in a cave with 20 rooms and 3 tunnels leading from each room.
There are 3 bats and 3 pits scattered throughout the cave, and your
quiver holds 5 custom super anti-evil Wumpus arrows. Good luck.

You are in room 6 of the cave, and have 5 arrows left.
*rustle* *rustle* (must be bats nearby)
*whoosh* (I feel a draft from some pits).
*sniff* (I can smell the evil Wumpus nearby!)
There are tunnels to rooms 5, 8, and 4.

Without conscious thought you grab for the side of the cave and manage
to grasp onto a rocky outcrop. Beneath your feet stretches the limitless
depths of a bottomless pit!  Rock crumbles beneath your feet!
You are in room 8 of the cave, and have 5 arrows left.

A horrible roar fills the cave, and you realize, with a smile, that you
have slain the evil Wumpus and won the game!  You don't want to tarry for
long, however, because the stench of a dead Wumpus is also quite well
known, a stench powerful enough to slay the mightiest adventurer with
a single whiff!!
Care to play another game? (y/n)
